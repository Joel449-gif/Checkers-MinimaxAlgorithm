A checkers AI using the minimax algorithm.

# MiniProject - Checkers using Minimax algorithm

A python implementation of the checkers game with an AI opponent based on the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.


## How to run this program

**Requirements:**
- python 3
  direct download: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- numpy: run 'pip install numpy' in the terminal while in any directory
- pygame: run 'pip install pygame' in the terminal while in any directory
- download assets , checkers and minimax file for GitHub : https://github.com/Joel449-gif/Checkers_MinimaxAlgo

**Running the game**
1. Navigate to the root directory of the project in the terminal
2. Run the command 'python3 <filename>'. For example 'main.py'

## Known issues
- draw implementation is lacking
- AI movements are visible
